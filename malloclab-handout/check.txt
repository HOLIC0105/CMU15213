Measuring performance with gettimeofday().

Testing mm malloc
Reading tracefile: ./traces/binary-bal.rep
Checking mm_malloc for correctness, efficiency, and performance.

Results for mm malloc:
trace  valid  util     ops      secs  Kops
 0       yes   55%   12000  0.000193 62305
Total          55%   12000  0.000193 62305

Perf index = 33 (util) + 40 (thru) = 73/100
